The Expense Manager App is a mobile application designed to help users track their financial transactions and manage expenses effectively. Built for iOS devices, this app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to record income and expenditure details seamlessly.

## Features

- **Transaction History**: View past transactions and track spending patterns over time.
  
- **Customizable Categories**: Customize transaction categories to suit individual financial management needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Primary programming language for iOS app development.
  
- **UIKit**: Used for building the user interface components.
  
- **Core Data**: For local data storage and management.
  
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows Model-View-ViewModel architecture for clear separation of concerns.

## Design Pattern

This application follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern. The MVVM pattern helps in separating the business logic, UI, and user input handling, which enhances code readability, maintainability, and testability.

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
  
- **View**: Represents the UI components and their visual representation.
  
- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling data binding and UI logic.
